# Sidcup Family Golf — Frontend

A small, static frontend project built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using a few helper libraries (for example GSAP) for animations and UI polish.

This project was created while following lectures from the YouTube channel "Shreyians Coding School".

## What this is

- A simple, client-side UI built with:
  - HTML (`index.html`) — markup and page structure
  - CSS (`style.css`) — styling and layout
  - JavaScript (`script.js`) — interactivity
- Optionally enhanced by libraries such as GSAP (GreenSock) — see `index.html` for the exact CDN/script includes.

## Features

- Simple interactive UI and animations.
- Lightweight: no build step required; works by opening `index.html` in a browser.

## File structure

- `index.html` — entry point
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — application JavaScript
- (optional) `assets/` or `images/` — any images or assets you add

If you add third-party libraries, they'll typically be referenced from CDN links inside `index.html`.

## Customization

- Replace images and update paths in `index.html`/CSS.
- Tweak animations in `script.js` (GSAP timeline or vanilla JS). If you remove GSAP, update `index.html` so the page doesn't try to reference it.
